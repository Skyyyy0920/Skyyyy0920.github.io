## Biography

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Virginia, advised by Prof. [Chen Chen](https://chenannie45.github.io/index.html). My research focuses on cutting-edge artificial intelligence, specifically AI for Science, Graph Neural Networks, and Large Language Models.

Before joining UVA, I earned my Bachelor’s degree from Nankai University, where I conducted early research in Recommendation Systems under Prof. [Xiangrui Cai](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2021/0323/c13620a549997/page.htm) and explored Explainable AI (XAI) at Prof. [Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/)’s [PRADA](https://pradalab1.github.io/) Laboratory.
